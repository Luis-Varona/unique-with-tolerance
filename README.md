# unique-with-tolerance

An algorithm to select unique values in arrays of imprecise floating-point data within a given tolerance, written in different languages. Given an array of numbers, the algorithm returns its largest subset in which no pairs of elements are approximately equal. (Two numbers `x` and `y` are said to be "approximately equal" within an absolute tolerance `atol` or a relative tolerance `rtol` if and only if <code>|xâ€¯- y| &leq; max(atol, rtol&#8729;max(|x|, |y|))</code>.)

A stable version for 1D arrays has been completed in several languages (although certain optimization steps remain). Out of these, the `C++` implementation is the fastest. I am currently adding functionality for operating along specified axes of multidimensional arrays and packaging the project into language-specific libraries.

Intended to facilitate data clustering in scientific computing contexts, this project was inspired by `MATLAB`'s `uniquetol` function and `NumPy`'s `unique` function.
