# unique-with-tolerance

An algorithm to select unique values in imprecise floating-point arrays with tolerance, written in different languages. Given an array of doubles, `uniquetol(arr)` returns the largest subset of elements such that no pairs are considered approximately equal.

Out of the different versions of this algorithm, the `C++` implementation is currently the fastest. The author is currently working on adding functionality for operating along specified axes of multidimensional arrays. This algorithm was inspired by `MATLAB`'s `uniquetol` function and `NumPy`'s `unique` function.
