# uniquetol.c

The `C` version of the algorithm, where `uniquetol.c` is the algorithm proper. The `tests` subfolder contains three files: `testarray.h`, `main.c`, and `benchmark_main.c`. `testarray.h` contains a function that outputs a fixed 729-element array with several bundles of approximately equal elements. `tests/main.c` contains a test case of the `uniquetol` function  on said array, and `tests/my_benchmark.c` runs `uniquetol` on the array 1 million times and checks the total time elapsed (approximately 65&ndash;67 seconds). (The `misc` and `prototyping` subfolders are to be ignored for now but may be used later when optimizing the algorithm further.)
